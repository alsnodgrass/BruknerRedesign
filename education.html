            <h3>Educator Resources</h3>

            <p>Brukner Nature Center is a 235 acre wildlife preserve - a wonderful setting for hands-on experiential education. We are home to over 50 Wildlife Ambassadors (bobcat, bald eagle, birds of prey, foxes, and more!), a great 
                variety of natural habitats (prairie, woodlands, wetlands and the Stillwater River), and the Iddings Log House, the oldest structure on its original site in Miami County. Our site is the ideal outdoor classroom for students 
                learning about Ohio’s wildlife and natural history.</p>
            <p>Brukner Nature Center offers both a variety of field trips on site, as well as outreach programs at your facility that focus on the wildlife around us. All programs are age appropriate and meet both Ohio State Standards and 
                scout badge requirements, while providing hands-on activities and visuals along with the unique opportunity to meet live wildlife native to Ohio.</p>
            <p>Brukner Nature Center staff has years of success in the field of environmental education. We’ve developed a number of hands-on field trips and outreach experiences for you to choose from!</p>
            <p>We can't wait to see you at BNC!
