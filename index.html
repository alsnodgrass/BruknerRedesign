            <h3>About Us</h3>

            <p>Brukner Nature Center opened to the public in 1974 and is the vision of Clayton J. Brukner, local philanthropist who was born December 18, 1896 in Ravenna, Nebraska. With high school chum and business partner, E.J. "Sam" Junkin, he brought the Weaver Aircraft Company to Troy, Ohio in 1923. The company name was eventually changed to the WACO 
                Aircraft Company, which became the most successful civil aircraft manufacturer of the pre World War II era.</p>
            <p>Clayton Brukner was an entrepreneur, mechanical genius, and community philanthropist. He had a great love for nature and in 1933 bought 146 acres of land along the Stillwater River, not known for its productivity, but rather for its natural beauty. In 1967 he unveiled his plans to build a nature center on this site and in May of 1974, Brukner 
                Nature Center opened to the public.  The 165 acre preserve is traversed by 6 miles of hiking trails, Interpretive Building and the 1804 Iddings Log House.</p>
            <p>Brukner Nature Center is a privately funded, nonprofit organization promoting the appreciation and understanding of wildlife conservation through preservation, education, and rehabilitation. The 1804 Iddings log house was renovated in 1980 and again in 2006. It is on the registry of Historic Places as the oldest structure on its original site 
                in Miami County!</p>
            <p>Under the guidance of our first Directors, Bob & Joan Heidelberg, we grew to a 165-acre preserve with services reaching 21 counties. Today, we annually touch over 45,000 people with our innovative hands-on wildlife programming. Each year over 120,000 visitors enjoy our public events, take a stroll in the woods or visit with our wildlife ambassadors.</p>
            <p>In 1998 an addition to Interpretive Building doubled the size and provides handicap accessibility to all three floors including our popular Tree-top Bird Vista. In May of 2011, we renovated the interpretive area in our downstairs wildlife exhibits.  Our main lobby renovation was completed in May 2016 and we just finished our wildlife rehabilitation 
                quarantine building in 2019!  Thank you to all of our supporters who have helped us reach all of our goals!</p>

            <h3>BNCâ€™s New Satallite Property
            <br />River's Edge Wildlife Preserve</h3>

            <p>Open from sunrise to sunset and is located just a few miles southwest of us.</p>

            <h5>Directions to Rivers Edge</h5>
            <p style = "font-style: italic;">Turn left out of Brukner Nature Center then take the first right onto Greenlee Rd., which will dead end into St. Rt. 55.  Turn right and follow S.Rt. 55 over the Stillwater River.  Turn left on Calumet Rd. immediately after crossing the bridge.  The parking area will be on your left.</p>
            <p class = "pt-2">The gravel lot provides space for 10 cars and access to a paver walkway leading to an information panel and our first and only trailhead, the Cascades Loop.  Enjoy this hike as it follows the crest of the ravine, providing excellent opportunities for birdwatching in the treetops below!  It then passes a small limestone cascade that flows only in the 
                wetter months, but is a unique ecosystem supporting rare flora and fauna.  The trail follows an old access road down into the forested valley then back up a gently sloping rise back to the parking lot.</p>
